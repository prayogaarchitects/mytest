All of us deserve some downtime, calm vibes, exposure to nature at its besotting best. We are proud to have ensured that we have been minimalistic and sustainable to the best of our efforts leaving a minimum carbon footprint. Everything here is handmade by local artisans, be it the sweet smelling pinewood benches and tables, the rattan chairs weaved with love using recycled plastic wire, the bamboo arch, the pinewood bar, the roofs or the rustic deck built for soaking in the gorgeous sunsets.",
